# Android Studio Logcat Color

We can add new colors to the Logcat messages by going to:
`Preferences → Editor → Color Scheme → Andoid Logcat`

And adjusting the Scheme to your needs. In the image I used the following colors:

`Assert: 9C27B0
Debug: 2196F3
Error: F44336
Info: 4CAF50
Verbose: default
Warning: FFC107`
