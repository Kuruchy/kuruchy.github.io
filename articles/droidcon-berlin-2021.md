# Droidcon Berlin 2021

I made it, I am back to conferences after the global pandemic. Last time I was in a Conference was in Copenhagen, December 2019, for the Kotlin Conf. Almost two years have past and a lot has changed since then. But I am happy to be back on track!

I will add an entry for each Day, where a will talk about all the talks I like the most.
