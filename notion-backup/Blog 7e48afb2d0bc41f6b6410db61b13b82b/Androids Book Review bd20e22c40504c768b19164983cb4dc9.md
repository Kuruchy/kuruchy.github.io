| Androids Book Review | [Book Review, Android] | Do you want to know why Android succeeded and how? Join me on my review of Androids - The Team That Built the Android Operating System. | 2021-9-19 |

In 2004, there were two people who wanted to build software for cameras. But they couldn't get investors interested. But Google was interested on building something like that, but for phones. Today, there's a large team at Google that builds software for cameras. Sort of XD.

In this book you will find all the reasons, according to the participants of the first years of Android Development, that led Android to succeed.

I would say that my understanding of why android succeeded is because they had the right people working on it, all of them sharing the same idea and all of them working really hard on the same goal. Decisions being made and encapsulating the devs from the outside noise was also really important.

### **Interesting Facts**

Interesting fact, while developing the kernel (that will ship with G1) they did it in a way it actually seems to have 32Mb less memory, forcing the developers to work harder to fit all into a tighter budget.

Wake locks were added to the Android Linux Kernel by Arve to ensure the screen-off didn't mean completely-off

### **Favorite Quote**

You're telling me we have to have just as good battery life as the iPhone. We have this capability to run all these apps in the background, the hardware that we have has a bigger screen, we run background tasks, we were the first to do 3G, and we also have a physically smaller battery.

### **Final note**

If you hate footnotes, avoid this book!
