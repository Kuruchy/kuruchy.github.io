| Add Colors to Logcat | [Tips, Android Studio] | Do you want your plain Logcat to be able to show different colors for each message type? I will show you how easy it is! | 2021-9-08 |

We can add new colors to the Logcat messages by going to:
`Preferences → Editor → Color Scheme → Andoid Logcat`

And adjusting the Scheme to your needs. In the image I used the following colors:
