| Actions in Android Studio | [Tips, Android Studio] | Did you always want to add new buttons to Android Studio to perform some actions that are not there? I will show you how easy it is! | 2021-9-03 |

One cool feature, I’ve recently found, is the possibility to add custom action buttons to almost anywhere in the Android Studio toolbars.

In my case, and I know most Android Developers could relate, I am hitting the infamous **Invalidate Caches & Restart** a couple of times a day. So as a way to make it happen faster (saving one mouse click, yeah!) I added a button to my Navigation Bar Toolbar.

To see what can be edited / added, you need to go to `Preferences → Appearance & Behavior → Menus and Toolbars`.

We can add actions to a lot of places, making our life easier.

To create a button and add an action, we click on the `+` icon, and we will get the possibility to `Add Action` or `Add Separation`.

If we choose the `Add Action`, we would get the following popup to choose the action we want.

You could also select a custom Icon for that action. I've chosen a “Fingers Crossed”.

And that’s it! You now have an Action that **Invalidate Caches & Restart**
