I always had this idea in mind writing down my experiences, tips, ideas and so on in a personal Blog.
I have tried once in the past, unsuccessfully, to create a blog where I wrote about tech in general. But I think I did not succeed because the topic was too broad. Or in other words, not so specific, which in the end made me try to create post about things I did not like. 

Now I start this again, but writing about Android development, Kotlin, Game dev, and also about climbing and bouldering. So I will annotate this Blog as `@Experimental` for now ;-)

Strange mixture of themes, but is exactly what makes my day. 

Apart from my family, programming and climbing are the two things I do get the most from.
