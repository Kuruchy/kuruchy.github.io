## Custom Action in Android Studio

One cool Feature I’ve recently found, is the possibility to add custom action buttons to almost anywhere in the Android Studio toolbars.

In my case, and I know most Android Developers could relate, I am hitting the infamous **Invalidate Caches & Restart** a couple of times a day. So as a way to make it happen faster (saving one mouse click, yeah!) I added a button to my Navigation Bar Toolbar.

To see what can be edited / added, you need to go to `Preferences/Appearance & Behavior/Menus and Toolbars`.

We can add actions to a lot of places, making our life easier.

To create a button and add an action, we click on the `+` icon and we will get the possibility to `Add Action` or `Add Separation`. 

If we choose the `Add Action`, we would get the following popup to choose the action we want.

You could also select a custom Icon for that action. I've chosen a “Fingers Crossed”.

And that’s it! You now have an Action that **Invalidate Caches & Restart**
